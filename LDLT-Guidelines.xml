            <head>Structure of an LDLT Edition</head>
            <p>This section describes the basic structure of the file that contains an edition for
               the Digital Latin Library's <bibl><title>Library of Digital Latin
                  Texts</title></bibl> (LDLT). The structure of an LDLT edition resembles the
               structure of a traditional printed critical edition:</p>
            <list>
               <head>Parts of an LDLT Edition</head>
               <item>Publication Details</item>
               <item>Front Matter</item>
               <item>Critical Text (including apparatus)</item>
               <item>Indices</item>
            </list>
            <p>Since every text is unique, not every LDLT edition will have all of these sections.
               The nature of the text and the editor's judgment will determine the contents of an
               edition. The purpose of this section is to define the parts of an LDLT edition and
               provide guidelines for representing them in XML.</p>
            <p>These guidelines are based on the standard set by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI),
               with modification and customization to accommodate the special characteristics of
               Latin texts.</p>

               <p>A traditional critical edition in print has a title page announcing the title of

               <p>Since a critical edition is often based upon many sources (e.g., manuscripts,
                  previous editions, commentaries, etc.), the <gi>teiHeader</gi> for an LDLT edition
                  does not hew strictly to the TEI guidelines for <gi>sourceDesc</gi>. The sources
                  for an LDLT edition are documented and described in the edition's front
                  matter.</p>
               <p>Just as an editor is not expected to create the title page and document the
                  publication information, this section of an LDLT is the responsibility of the DLL
                  staff.</p>
            </div2>
            <div2 xml:id="front-matter">
               <head>Front Matter</head>
               <p>The <gi>front</gi> contains numbered divisions and subdivisions (e.g.,
                     <gi>div1</gi>, <gi>div2</gi>) corresponding to the preface, bibliography, and
                  conspectus for the edition.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="bold">preface</hi> lays out (in prose, using <gi>p</gi>) the
                  argument for the edition. It also describes the textual tradition and the major
                  sources for it, which is why it is recommended to compile the bibliography first,
                  to take advantage of the ability to link to individual entries in the
                  bibliography. For example, prefaces traditionally contain a description in prose
                  of the manuscripts consulted in establishing the text of the edition. The preface
                  of an LDLT can include prose descriptions of manuscripts, but it should also link
                  to structured (i.e., machine-readable) data for the manuscript in the edition's
                  bibliography.</p>
               <p>The elements available in all TEI documents are available for use in the preface.
                  For example, an editor might want to make a table comparing the readings of
                  manuscript families. In that case, the editor would use <gi>table</gi> and its
                  related elements.</p>
            </div2>
            <div2 xml:id="bibliography">
               <head>Bibliography</head>
               <!-- Issue: Should a consensus siglum be an xml:id on a <listBibl> containing the items, or a separate siglum listed elsewhere? -->
               <!-- Issue: One <forename> for first and middle names? Or separate <forename> for each? -->
               <!-- Issue: Nicknames. Should they be in parentheses with <surname>, or should they be in <addname> by themselves? -->
               <p>The bibliography presents opportunities for leveraging the digital nature of an
                  LDLT edition. Because every item in the bibliography is encoded as structured data
                  (contained in <gi>msDesc</gi> or <gi>biblStruct</gi>), the bibliography itself can
                  become a useful tool for finding and using resources, especially those that are
                  available online.</p>
               <p>The bibliography is all the more useful as a tool if it is created and made
                  available via <ref target="http://www.zotero.org">Zotero</ref>, an open, online
                  resource for building and managing bibliographies. In addition to providing an
                  interface for compiling and managing a bibliography, Zotero can also export
                  bibliographies in a TEI XML format that requires little to no modification for
                  inclusion in an LDLT edition. Users can copy and paste Zotero information directly
                  into an LDLT edition file. For these reasons, it is highly recommended that all
                  LDLT editions have a corresponding Zotero repository for their bibliography.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately, Zotero does not currently provide a format for describing and
                  cataloging manuscripts, so that information must be entered manually. For that
                  reason, and for the sake of completeness, the following sections provide
                  information for encoding items in the bibliography, with examples.</p>

                     apparatus, if they are not listed elsewhere in the bibliography (e.g., as the
                     editor of an edition or author of an article). It is common, for example, to
                     refer to a scholar whose unpublished notes appear in a commentary or who has
                     corresponded with the editor. For ease of reference, these sources should be
                     listed with information about where the information can be verified.</p>

                  <head>Human- and Machine-Readable Sigla, Symbols, and Abbreviations</head>
                  <p>Printed editions have long used a system of shorthand references for
                     manuscripts and other materials in the bibliography. Single letters, or <emph
                        rend="italic">sigla</emph>, stand for a manuscript, and the last name of a
                     scholar serves as a shorthand reference to an edition, commentary, or other
                     work of scholarship. Centuries of publication have demontrated that sigla and
                     other symbols and abbreviations are efficient, effective, and economic ways of
                     conveying complex information in critical editions. But they are also examples
                     of visually encoded information that is available only to human readers. In
                     other words, a human might see <hi rend="bold">N²</hi> and correctly interpret
                     it within a perticular edition as meaning "text written by the second person in
                     a succession of people who wrote in the manuscript known as codex Neapolitanus
                     V A 8." But a machine will interpret the same information as simply the letter
                     N with a superscript numeral 2 next to it.</p>
                  <p>To make an LDLT text readable by both humans and machines, there must be a
                     system of reference that leverages both the traditional approach that has
                     served textual criticism so well for so long and new ways of making information
                     available to machines for processing and sophisticated analysis. To accomplish
                     that goal, each item in the bibliography of an LDLT edition must have two
                     unique identifiers: one for humans and one for machines.</p>
                  <p>For the latter, the XML specification has the <att>xml:id</att> attribute,
                     which has <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-id/">strict rules</ref> that
                     do not allow for the traditional conventions used in critical editions. For the
                     former, the TEI standard has <att>n</att>, which allows for all of the usual
                     conventions. In same instances, the two attributes might be identical. For
                     example, if a manuscript is known by the siglum <hi rend="bold">V</hi>, it is
                     possible to identify it to machines as <att>xml:id</att>="V" and to humans as
                        <att>n</att>="V". But if an editor must refer to a number of manuscripts
                     from the same collection designated as <hi rend="bold">V</hi>, the usual
                     practice in a printed critical edition is to use the letter V to stand for the
                     collection with subscript numerals distinguishing the different manuscripts. In
                     an LDLT edition, the second one in the series would have <att>xml:id</att> of
                     "V2", but the <att>n</att> would be V₂. Humans can read and understand both
                     easily, but machines need a simpler method of identifying something.</p>
                  <p><hi rend="bold">Every entry, regardless of type, in the bibliography of an LDLT
                        edition must have values for both <att>xml:id</att> and <att>n</att>.</hi>
                     Otherwise, the edition will not be able to make full use of the digital format.
                     Morever, if an entry lacks <att>n</att>, it will not be available for the print
                     version of the edition.</p>

                     <head>List of Scholars</head>
                     <p>Occasionally it is necessary to refer to a scholar whose unpublished work
                        has been quoted or paraphrased elsewhere. For example, editors often cite
                        Nicolaas Heinsius' unpublished conjectures, found in books in his own
                        library. But "Heins." does not help a reader find more information. That is
                        why the bibliography of an LDLT edition includes a list of scholars
                        mentioned by name in the edition, with information about where to find their
                        remarks, if they are available.</p>

            <head>Edition Text</head>
            <p>The edition text corresponds to the text printed "above the line" of the critical
               apparatus in a traditional edition. It is composed of "accepted readings," that is,
               text judged by the editor to be authoritative.</p>
            <p>There may be more than one authoritative version of a text, depending on the text and
               depending on the approach adopted by the editor. Authors sometimes edit and revise
               their work over time. Scribes often record the version of the text that makes sense
               in their context. Scholars and other readers offer conjectures for problematic
               passages. But an editor must make decisions about the text and edition presents to
               readers. The results of those decisions are on display in the official edition
               text.</p>
            <p>Since the online version of an LDLT allows readers to swap readings from the critical
               apparatus into the main text, it is possible to encounter many versions of the text
               in one viewing of it, but the official edition text is the starting point for those
               interactions.</p>
            <p>This section establishes guidelines for encoding the information typically found in
               the main text of a critical edition.</p>

               printed in the main portion of a critical edition.</p>
            <p xml:id="rdg"><gi>rdg</gi> (reading) contains some text (or absence of text) witnessed
               by a manuscript or found in an early printed edition where it is not expressly
               proposed, but judged by the editor to be unsatisfactory or corrupt for linguistic
               and/or stylistic reasons. This text is printed in the apparatus criticus.</p>
            <p xml:id="wit"><att>wit</att> (witness) indicates any manuscript(s) or early printed
               edition(s) (esp. without an apparatus or commentary; i.e., <foreign xml:lang="la"

               the text.</p>
            <p><att>ana</att> (analysis) indicates that a reading belongs to at least one category

               <p>A <ref target="#wit">witness</ref> or <ref target="#source">source</ref> has a
                  reading that varies from the lemma in some way. For example, if the editor has
                  accepted the text <quote xml:lang="la">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</quote> into the
                  main text of the edition, but manuscript <hi rend="bold">A</hi> has <quote
                     xml:lang="la">larem</quote> instead of <quote xml:lang="la">lorem</quote>, the
                  variant reading would be reported in a printed edition as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <quote>18 larem <hi rend="bold">A</hi></quote>
               </p>
               <p>Since the lemma is not typically printed in an apparatus criticus (unless there is
                  a chance for confusion), it is up to the reader to recognize that <quote
                     xml:lang="la">larem</quote> is a variant for <quote xml:lang="la"
                  >lorem</quote>.</p>
               <p>In this model, an <gi>app</gi> contains both the lemma and the variant reading,
                  reducing the need for guesswork, at least when looking at the XML code.</p>
               <p>The patterns displayed below are designed to handle the various kinds of
                  information conveyed in a typical apparatus criticus, including readings <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">ante correctionem</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">in
                     rasura</foreign>, among other paleographical and editorial details.</p>

               <head>Conjecture</head>
               <p>A conjecture is some portion of text (or absence of text) proposed by some person
                  (ancient or modern) and determined by an editor to be worthy of consideration in
                  establishing the text, but not to be printed in the main text of the edition.</p>
               <p>In a traditional critical edition, a conjecture might be noted as follows:
                     <quote>rapidoque] rabidoque <hi rend="italic">conj.</hi> Baehrens</quote>.</p>
               <p>Although conjectures are more common in modern editions and other scholarship,
                  they are not unheard of in manuscripts, where a hand has written a reading (e.g.,
                  in the margin) that does not resemble any other variant readings and cannot be
                  attributed to a recognizable error. Therefore, conjecture is not limited to those
                  materials identified in <att>source</att>. For this reason, <att>type</att> with
                  value "conjecture" must be used to identify a reading as a conjecture.</p>
