               <head>Basic reporting of a variant reading</head>
               <p>A <ref target="#wit">witness</ref> or <ref target="#source">source</ref> has a reading that varies from the lemma in some way. For example, if the editor has accepted the text <quote xml:lang="la">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</quote> into the main text of the edition, but manuscript <hi rend="bold">A</hi> has <quote xml:lang="la">larem</quote> instead of <quote xml:lang="la">lorem</quote>, the variant reading would be reported in a printed edition as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <quote>18 larem <hi rend="bold">A</hi></quote>
               </p>
               <p>Since the lemma is not typically printed in an apparatus criticus (unless there is a chance for confusion), it is up to the reader to recognize that <quote xml:lang="la">larem</quote> is a variant for <quote xml:lang="la">lorem</quote>.</p>
               <p>In this model, an <gi>app</gi> contains both the lemma and the variant reading, eliminating the need for guesswork.</p>
